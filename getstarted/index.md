# How to get started
This chapter contains guides on how to get started with Gefyra.
There are some platform specific hints for the setup. Gefyra itself
works the same for all different platforms. The guides mostly focus
on preparing your Kubernetes environment for Gefyra. Once this is 
done there is an example workload available to try out the Gefyra CLI.
